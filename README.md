essence, all the moving parts are visible so you can judge for yourself whether the tool merits your confidence. In the case of a program, this means that complete source code must be available, and that you can verify that the program you're running corresponds to the source code provided.

The very nature of JavaScript achieves this transparency. The programs are embedded into the Web pages you interact with; to examine them you need only use your browser's “View Source” facility, or save the page into a file on your computer and read it with a text editor; any JavaScript components the pages reference can be similarly downloaded and examined in source code form. JavaScript's being an interpreted language eliminates the risk of your running a program different from the purported source code: with an interpreted language what you read is what you run.

Transparency is important even if you don't know enough about programming or security to determine whether the programs contain any flaws. The very fact that they can be examined by anybody allows those with the required expertise to pass judgment, and you can form your own conclusions based on their analysis.

The JavaScript implementation of the AES (Rijndael) encryption algorithm was developed by Fritz Schneider; it has been modified slightly for use in JavaScrypt but produces output identical to the reference implementation.

The JavaScript implementation of the MD5 message-digest algorithm was developed by Henri Torgemane; please view the source code file md5.js to examine the code, including the copyright notice and conditions of use. The MD5 algorithm was developed by Ron Rivest.

The JavaScript implementation of the SHA-2 hash functions SHA-224 and SHA-256 is by Chen, Yi-Cyuan and released under the MIT License, which is included in the source code file sha256.js. The original code is available on GitHub.
